Initially, Stephen rated the interview
with Michael J. Fox a 3, but in retrospect,
it actually wasn't that bad!
As a user, I should be able to edit an
appearance so that I can change a rating.
Build out the edit functionality for
 an appearance, keeping with RESTful conventions.
    -- issue with saving of Updated information :-(

We want to add some more validations
 to our models -
an appearance should only be
valid if it has a rating on it that's
between 1 and 5.
--- DONE
        -- on model validation


When we create a new appearance,
 we should also keep track of the
 producer who booked
that appearance. This means that
an appearance should also belong to a user.
Update your schema, models, and
forms to reflect this.
    --- done i think
